### React typescript kanban board

My first react project.

Roadmap:

1. Follow tutorial that helps create simple trello clone with React. I've decided to start it with typescript instead of pure js which proved to be quite a hassle at times, but definitely worth it over all.

2. Make it my own
    - [ ] Styles - light and dark mode. Design that looks slightly less boilerplate.
    - [ ] User preferences
    - [ ] Multiple boards and ways to switch between them
    - [ ] Visualize board entries on a calendar
    - [ ] Host it online with user login, database and sync (Aws or Firebase?)
    - [ ] Landing page
    - [ ] Connect to github - tags in comments, pull requests or issues
    - [ ] Desktop app - Electron or Java (I'm sorry)
    - [ ] Mobile app (Little birdie told me flutter is cool)
